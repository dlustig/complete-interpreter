Lexical Analyzer, Syntax Analyzer, and Interpreter


This is a complete enterpreter for a programming language called Sloth. The code is very similar to C.
Purpose: This project's goal is to take a file of source code and effectively execute it.

1. Lexical Analyzer - This takes a string of source code and breaks it down into a stream of tokens.
2. Syntax Analyzer - This takes the stream of tokens given by the Lexer, and places them into a parse tree.
3. Interpeter - This analyzes and executes the parse tree in its predefined order.
